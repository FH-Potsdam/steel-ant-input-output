# conditions

Here you see how to use conditions. We are using the `if else` and the `switch` statements. Take a look at the upper right corner. We added a console the this page for easier viewing.  

## sketch.js 
{% highlight js %}
{% include_relative sketch.js %}
{% endhighlight %}
## index.html 
{% highlight js %}
{% include_relative index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
